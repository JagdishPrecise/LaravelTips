# Laravel Best Practices: Limiting env Calls to Config Files for Better Performance and Stability

When building Laravel applications, it's common to use the `env()` function to retrieve configuration values from your `.env` file. While this is a convenient way to access these values, it can have a negative impact on your application's performance and stability, especially when you call `env()` repeatedly.

In this article, we'll explore a best practice for improving performance and stability by limiting `env()` calls to config files.

## The Problem with env()

The `env()` function reads the `.env` file and retrieves the value associated with the given key. This can be useful for accessing configuration values throughout your application, but it has a few drawbacks:

- **Performance**: Reading from disk can be slow, especially if you're calling `env()` repeatedly.
- **Stability**: If the `.env` file is missing or has incorrect values, it can cause errors or unexpected behavior in your application.

## The Solution: Config Files

Instead of calling `env()` directly, you can store your configuration values in a config file and use the `config()` function to retrieve them. This approach has several benefits:

- **Performance**: Config files are cached by Laravel, so they can be read much faster than the `.env` file.
- **Stability**: Config files are validated by Laravel, so any missing or incorrect values will be detected at runtime and reported as errors.

Here's an example of how to use a config file:

1. Create a config file in the `config` directory, e.g. `config/myconfig.php`
2. Define your configuration values in the file:

   ```php
   <?php

   return [
       'my_key' => env('MY_KEY', 'default_value'),
   ];

3. Retrieve the value in your application using config('myconfig.my_key'). By using config files instead of env(), you can improve the performance and stability of your Laravel application.
