## Did you know that when generating a model using `php artisan make:model`, you can add additional flags to include extra features?

When generating a model in Laravel using the `php artisan make:model` command, you can add additional flags to include extra features. For example, you can use the `--migration` flag to generate a migration file along with the model, or use the `--factory` flag to generate a factory for the model.

Here are some of the most useful flags you can use when generating a model:

- `--all`: Generates a migration, factory, and seeder for the model.
- `--migration`: Generates a migration file for the model.
- `--factory`: Generates a factory for the model.
- `--controller`: Generates a controller for the model.
- `--resource`: Generates a resource controller for the model.
- `--api`: Generates an API controller for the model.

For example, if you want to generate a model with a migration and a factory, you can use the following command:

php artisan make:model Post --migration --factory


This will generate a `Post` model, a migration file for the `posts` table, and a factory for the `Post` model.

Using these additional flags can save you time and help streamline your development workflow.
