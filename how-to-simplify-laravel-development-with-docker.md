# How to Simplify Laravel Development with Docker

Docker is a powerful tool that allows you to run your application in an isolated environment, with all the dependencies and configurations pre-installed. This can greatly simplify the process of setting up a development environment, especially for complex applications like Laravel.

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of setting up a Laravel development environment with Docker. We'll cover the following topics:

- Installing Docker
- Setting up a Dockerfile for Laravel
- Using Docker Compose to manage the containers
- Connecting to the Laravel container
- Running Laravel commands inside the container

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional Laravel development environment running in Docker, ready for you to start coding.

## Installing Docker

Before we get started, you'll need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker from the official website for your operating system.

## Setting up a Dockerfile for Laravel

Once you have Docker installed, the next step is to set up a Dockerfile for Laravel. A Dockerfile is a script that contains all the instructions necessary to build a Docker image. 

Here's an example Dockerfile that you can use as a starting point:

FROM php:7.4-fpm

RUN apt-get update
&& apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends
git
zip
unzip
libpq-dev
libzip-dev
&& docker-php-ext-install
pdo
pdo_pgsql
zip

RUN curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer

WORKDIR /var/www/html

COPY . /var/www/html/

RUN composer install

CMD php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080


This Dockerfile starts with the official PHP 7.4 FPM image, installs some necessary dependencies and extensions, installs Composer, sets the working directory to `/var/www/html`, copies the Laravel application code to the container, installs the dependencies using Composer, and sets the command to run the Laravel server.

## Using Docker Compose to manage the containers

Now that we have our Dockerfile set up, we can use Docker Compose to manage the containers. Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications.

Here's an example `docker-compose.yml` file that you can use to define your Laravel environment:

version: '3'

services:
web:
build:
context: .
dockerfile: Dockerfile
ports:
- "8080:8080"
volumes:
- .:/var/www/html
depends_on:
- db
db:
image: postgres:13
environment:
POSTGRES_USER: homestead
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret
POSTGRES_DB: homestead


This `docker-compose.yml` file defines two services: `web` and `db`. The `web` service builds the Docker image using the `Dockerfile` we created earlier, maps port `8080` to the host machine, mounts the current directory to `/var/www/html` inside the container, and depends on the `db` service. The `db` service uses the official Postgres 13 image and sets some environment variables.

## Connecting to the Laravel container

To connect to the Laravel container, you can use the following command:

docker-compose exec web /bin/bash

This will open a Bash shell inside the `web` container. From here,
